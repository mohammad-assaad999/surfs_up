## Overview of the analysis
  After a long time of analyzing the place where W. Avy wants to start his new business, I was asked to get temperature data for the June and December in Oahu in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
## Results
  After finishing all the work and getting all the statistics, we can see that a major difference between the temperture of the months of June and December occurs:

  - The average temperature in June in Oahu is around 75 which greater than the average temprature in December which is almost 71. 
  - The minimum and maximum temprature in June are 64 and 85, respectively. The difference is much lower than the one in December because the minimum is 56 and the maximum is 83. 
  - Finally, 50% of the results are lower than 75 in June and 71 in December.
